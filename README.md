# Employee or Contributor Call Options

This smart contract is a basic primative for creating call options that are stored with an NFT.  
They may be used to reward employees or contributors, or even community members with token options.  
The code is flexible so that there is no predefined pricing or specifications, it can be used however the DAO / company sees best fit. 
The NFTs are enumerable so that they can be adopted into other integrations, and can be traded on NFT marketplaces.
